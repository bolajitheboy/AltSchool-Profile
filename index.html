    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a 23 year old Software Quality Assurance Analyst with a strong passion for technology, innovation, and problem-solving.
      I’m naturally curious and enjoy understanding how systems work — from code to real-world structures.
      Outside of tech, I enjoy writing books, storytelling, and exploring new ideas.

    <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
    <p>
      I joined AltSchool Africa because I was looking for a structured and supportive environment to build solid,
      real-world software engineering skills. The project-based learning model and focus on excellence were exactly
      what I needed to make a career transition into tech with clarity and accountability.
